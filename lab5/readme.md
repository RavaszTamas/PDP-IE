# Parallelizing techniques

# Regular polynomial multiplication

* Complexity: O(n^2)
* Step  1:  Distribute each term of the to every term of the second polynomial.  Remember that when you multiply two terms together you must multiply the coefficient (numbers) and add the exponents
* Step 2:  Combine like terms (if you can)

# Karatsuba algorithm

* Complexity:  O(n^log3)
* A  fast  multiplication  algorithm  that  uses  a  divide  and conquers approach to multiply two numbers
